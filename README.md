# WordsWorth

This is the code that will sort all the words that are present in the text files. 

It will take inputs for the text files from the command line and then sort the words. It does the sorting using the binary search tree. The binary search tree will 
have the first word as the root. If the next word repeated the word that was already present in the tree, it would increment the counter. 

The ouput will be shown in the output file that is generated shows all the words in alphabetical order. This is achieved using InOrder tree traversal on the Binary Search tree. Along with the words also the occurance of the words is also displayed.
